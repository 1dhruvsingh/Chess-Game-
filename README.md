This Python-based chess project is designed with an object-oriented approach, encapsulating the game's various components such as the board, pieces, moves, AI, and UI elements within distinct classes. The relationships between these classes are carefully structured to reflect their real-world interactions, ensuring that each part of the game can be managed and extended independently. This modular design facilitates maintainability and scalability, making it easier to implement additional features or modify existing ones.
